Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> groups
Rule 1     groups -> group groups
Rule 2     groups -> group
Rule 3     groups -> empty
Rule 4     data -> INDEX DATE_TIME groups PRECIPITATION
Rule 5     group -> GROUP
Rule 6     empty -> <empty>

Terminals, with rules where they appear

DATE_TIME            : 4
GROUP                : 5
INDEX                : 4
PRECIPITATION        : 4
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

data                 : 
empty                : 3
group                : 1 2
groups               : 1 4 0
